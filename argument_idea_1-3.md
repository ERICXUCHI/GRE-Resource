1.  Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a "Palean" basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean. 

    Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

另有他因：有可能baskets自己漂过去的

CA：时间太长，boats已经毁坏没有了

时间：原来没有河



2.  The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a scientific journal. 

    "A recent study of eighteen rhesus monkeys provides clues as to the effects of birth order on an individual's levels of stimulation. The study showed that in stimulating situations (such as an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as much of the hormone cortisol, which primes the body for increased activity levels, as do their younger siblings. Firstborn humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence). The study also found that during pregnancy, first-time mother monkeys had higher levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring." 

    Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.


这个好难。。。

强加因果：妈妈有high cortisol并不一定会使孩子有high cortisol，因为firstborn child may have some responsibility to protect the family or something else, so they has relative high cortisol.

CA：只是巧合，unless more evidence

证词：并不知道研究了多少猴子，有可能只是一小部分或者特定区域的后猴子.

类比：人和猴子



3.  The following appeared as a letter to the editor from a Central Plaza store owner. "Over the past two years, the number of shoppers in Central Plaza has been steadily decreasing while the popularity of skateboarding has increased dramatically. Many Central Plaza store owners believe that the decrease in their business is due to the number of skateboard users in the plaza. There has also been a dramatic increase in the amount of litter and vandalism throughout the plaza. Thus, we recommend that the city prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. If skateboarding is prohibited here, we predict that business in Central Plaza will return to its previously high levels." 

    Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.


另有他因：litter和vandalism并不仅仅因为skateboarding，还有可能是visitor变多等等

CA：有可能是Central Plaza自己的运营出了问题，比如供货不足或者服务态度下降导致shopper减少

时间：谁也不知道将来会发生什么，有可能会有另一个运动兴起，所以prohibition永远不是一个wise option
