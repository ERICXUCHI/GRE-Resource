Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.

一：有道理：竞争使人进步，激励创新→leaders的竞争往往会对一个集团的产生影响→而这种影响在某种程度会对这个field的发展产生重大作用→从而反过来促进竞争→使得该field源源不断的发展

二：也有道理：合作才能共赢→一个个体再多的智慧也终究是有限的→所以只有把众多智慧结合到一起，才能够全面的看待问题→这样才能够更快更好促进整个行业的发展

加码段：还是要合作→竞争的目的是narrow in scope的→从大的角度来说，任何领域的进步都是为了人类世界的发展，社会的向前→而很明显合作的价值会对这种目的产生更加积极的作用→所以还是要合作



14.  In any field of inquiry, the beginner is more likely than the expert to make important contributions.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.

agree：新手不受陈旧思想的束缚→对于该领域有更多自己独特全新的视角→即使有一些可能不切实际，但it is likely some idea could change the whole field→一旦这些想法成真→可能就是从量变到质变的飞跃

disagree：新手也意味着没有经验，不切实际→他们可能会有很多天马行空的想法，但往往cannot come to realism→由此甚至会造成资源和时间的浪费→另外，新手不懂得这个field目前的问题和现状→所以他们做出important contribution可能会很难

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.

agree：懂得更多→理解事情的角度就会变多→所以事情就会变得更复杂→同时，我们会从自己的已知中去寻找类似的事情→然后去分析比对他们的异同，这也会使得需要思考的东西变多，甚至不确定性也会随之增加

disagree：当我们有了更多的知识→我们就可以从更多的角度思考问题→那么以前不可解的问题有可能就可以解决了→另外，当我们有了足够的案例，我们就可以很快的找到解决问题的方法，从而intangible的问题就会显得simple了
