7.  The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.

    Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.

agree：赞美是一个人做好事的动力之一→当我们不断去学生的积极行为时，为了得到赞扬，他们会去做更多的benevolence→与此同时，由于negative action不会得到表扬，所以他们会减少这类行为→久而久之，好事做多了就会成为一种习惯

disagree：得到表扬确实可以激励做好事→但是人们做坏事的目的并不是为了compliment，而是为了私利所采取的unethical的手段→如果这些negative action被忽略的→那么从某种程度上来说当事人就认为这种方式实现自己目的是被认可的→从而他们会继续采取这种方式甚至是变本加厉→这也彻底违背了教育的目的



8.  College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them rather than the courses that seem most likely to lead to jobs.

    Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.

9.  Competition for high grades seriously limits the quality of learning at all levels of education.

    Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.

agree： high grades意味着great performance in exam→也就是说，learning level equals the scores of the final paper→那么likely学生只去在意考试考什么，而不是自己真正掌握什么→这就会造成一种现象即面向考试教育（exam-oriented education）→这势必会qualify the level of education and learning

disagree： high grades是一个学生学习水平最直接的体现→low grades必然意味着学生对于知识掌握的不牢，education的直接目的就没有实现→moreover，in order to get more scores学生会尽己所能去学习更多的知识和background，这样更有利于学生自身自学水平的提高和获取知识的能力→教育的本质就是让学生学会学习



10.  All parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools.

     Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.

agree：父母是孩子第一任老师→孩子有问题父母可以第一时间发现→让父母volunteer time to their children’s school→可以更好的发现孩子身上的问题，同时，也可以使得陪伴更多，更好的参与到孩子的成长→minimize the gap and have more common words

disagree： school is a simplicity of a society→让父母参与其中势必会影响到孩子的独立性和自主性→由于学生自身的自我判断并不总是与父母相同，it is likely that parents would censure their children for some wrong or even inappropriate things→而这样很大可能导致孩子的叛逆和反抗，也会增加家庭矛盾→父母事无巨细的陪伴会影响孩子自我意识的形成



11.  Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.

agree：文化在一个人的experience中扮演着很重要的角色→它往往会影响着学生的思维方式和处事风格（way of thinking and manner of deal with things）→而出国交流则是文化交流的一个绝好的契机→通过国外学习，学生可以了解更多的background and context，还可以看到一些cutting-edge advances→这些都可以对自己当前的研究或者学习提供启发和思路→与此同时，也会认识一些志同道合的朋友，扩大交际圈（enlarge the social hub）→facilitate the future

disagree：在外国学到的知识在本国也可以学到→如果没有明确的目标，仅仅是为了出去看一看→我觉得这是在浪费时间和金钱→to be honest，这种交流的意义is like more traveling than learning→除此之外，such behavior may distract students‘ attention，并对他们在original field of study造成影响
