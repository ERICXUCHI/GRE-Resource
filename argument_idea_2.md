10.  Twenty years ago, Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island of Tertia. Using an observation-centered approach to studying Tertian culture, he concluded from his observations 
     that children in Tertia were reared by an entire village rather than by their own biological parents. 
     Recently another anthropologist, Dr. Karp, visited the group of islands that includes Tertia and 
     used the interview-centered method to study child-rearing practices. In the interviews that Dr. 
     Karp conducted with children living in this group of islands, the children spent much more time 
     talking about their biological parents than about other adults in the village. Dr. Karp decided that 
     Dr. Field's conclusion about Tertian village culture must be invalid. Some anthropologists recommend that to obtain accurate information on Tertian child-rearing practices, future research 
     on the subject should be conducted via the interview-centered method. 

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to 
decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

强加因果：不能因为谈论亲生父母多就确定F的论断无效。谈论多不等于抚养，有可能仅仅是印象深刻或者比较有代表性，其次我们并不知道interview的怎么directed的

CA或者时间：20年的时间足以改变一些事情，并不能推测其无效

类比：further research与这个study可能有本质的区别



15.  The following memorandum is from the business manager of Happy Pancake House restaurants.

     "Recently, butter has been replaced by margarine in Happy Pancake House restaurants throughout the southwestern United States. This change, however, has had little impact on our customers. In fact, only about 2 percent of customers have complained, indicating that an average of 98 people out of 100 are happy with the change. Furthermore, many servers have reported that a number of customers who ask for butter do not complain when they are given margarine instead. Clearly, either these customers do not distinguish butter from margarine or they use the term 'butter' to refer to either butter or margarine."

Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

CA： 2%的人投诉并不等于98%的人满意

另有他因：当时没有complain可能是因为他们很忙或者有更重要的事情，或者已经不去这家店了

证词：server的性质和数量都没有提及



16.  The following appeared in a memorandum from the manager of WWAC radio station. 

     "To reverse a decline in listener numbers, our owners have decided that WWAC must change from its current rock-music format. The decline has occurred despite population growth in our listening area, but that growth has resulted mainly from people moving here after their retirement. We must make listeners of these new residents. We could switch to a music format tailored to their tastes, but a continuing decline in local sales of recorded music suggests limited interest in music. Instead we should change to a news and talk format, a form of radio that is increasingly popular in our area." 

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

另有他因：ways of listening music变多了，人们不在局限于recorded music，Internet and mobile…etc

证词：如何调查的？只有一小部分人喜欢news and talk，改完之后还是不令大部分人满意

CA： decline in local sales o recorded music不能说明limited interest，有可能是所提供选择的音乐太少了
