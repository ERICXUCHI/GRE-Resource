The author simplistically(片面) claims that the discontinuing of the Endure manufacturing process(EWP) could help improve the profits of the company. 
However, the author does not consider that the profit is actually defined as a dynamic(动态) result of both revenues and costs, and a simple adjustment in just one section in the equation could not deliver the expected result.
on the one hand, the durability should be the basis for customers to choose Dura Sock every three months, so the discontinuing of the EMP might impact the quality negatively and lead to the loss of both potential and existing customers, and it eventually is a decline in the revenue side. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the cost does reduce from such an action, but the cost reduction might not necessarily compensate the loss in the revenues. 
Accordingly, the profit improvement cannot be guaranteed as the author initially proposes in the argument.
